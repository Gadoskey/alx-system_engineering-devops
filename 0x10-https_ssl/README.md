# HTTPS SSL

In this project, I learned about the importance of HTTPS and how it works. I configured my HolbertonBnB web servers with
 certbot certificate and HAproxy SSL termination.

## Tasks

* **0. World wide web**
  * [0. World wide web](./0. World wide web): Bash script that displays information about subdomains on my configured servers.
* **1-haproxy_ssl_termination**
  * [1-haproxy_ssl_termination](./0. World wide web): HAproxy configuration file that accepts encrypted SSL traffic for the subdomain www. on TCP port 443.
* **100-redirect_http_to_https**
  * [100-redirect_http_to_https](./100-redirect_http_to_https): HAproxy configuration file that automatically redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
